        My passion lies in crafting software products with valuable and accessible user experiences.
        This started as a hobby, which became after a while a full-time job. I started to create
        websites using WordPress, and later on I became a WordPress developer helping as well at
        creation of
        <a href="https://zionbuilder.io/" class="text-casal-950 dark:text-scooter-300"
            >Zion Builder visual page builder</a
        >.

        My Javascript / TypeScript experience is mostly in Vue.js framework or vanilla TypeScript,
        but I like to experience other technologies as well. It's not only about a type of
        framework. It's mostly about the algorithm you choose and the way you can apply certain
        programming principles - I like to write comprehensive code, which is easy to be understood
        by others.

        In my spare time I like "to play with pencils". My educational and previous professional
        background is in architectural and urban studies which helped me in approaching all types of
        projects from a multidisciplinary point of view.
